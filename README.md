# Grid Game:

Exploring the Phaser 3 game engine and Socket.io real-time messaging by implementing a version of the game Genius Square.

## About:

I programmed Grid Game as part of a hackathon project. This project allowed me to explore two of my interests as a software engineer: game design and real-time messaging/websocket technology.

I also used Socket.io to develop a multiplayer proof-of-concept for Grid Game that allows for multiple clients to play at the same time with the same game board, viewing their opponent's tile moves, flips, and rotations in real-time.

## Starting:

To run:

```bash
npm i
node server.js
```

Files also include separate game and HTML files to explore the multiplayer version!

## Multiplayer:
